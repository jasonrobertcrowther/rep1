This was a video that I edited and put together for a basketball leavers celebration

The concept behind this was to create an emotional yet fun interview type video with all the players in the same age group that all leaving the club going onto university or jobs. 

This was filmed in secret so that the coaches to which this is dedicated had no idea of the content.

This was a fun project because I got to write a script of questions and edit together some of the clips out of order

Sometimes the content is the most difficult thing.

I have the infrastucture and the methodology just need to put some structure to it and a common theme.

Luckily Hugo has a great repository of prebuilt themes so I picked one that gave me the option for a blog type layout with the option of adding menus for various sections.

I have kept the layout quite simply deliberately. The home page gives all my posts in an order in which I want the content to be read (if the reader wants to read all the content). There is a menu option to My Portfolio which only shows the actual video content again in a specific order and then an archive section that shows the posts by date order. This will become more appropriate as time goes on

Finally there is an about me page that gives a brief summary of who I am

Every page/blog post I upload allows me to create tags so I can search for specific tags at any point.

Finally the actual content. Since YouTube have already created the biggest video sharing platform on the planet - it makes sense to use that. I just need to upload my content into unlisted locations and then link to it from the blog posts.

From now on, adding content and adding structure is all quite easy. Content is based upon simple text files with "markdown" formatting instructions and tags and links to external content. Additional menus can be added at any point simply with the use of additional tags and creating a menu linked to that tag

So infrastructure and layout done - now just the content itself.....

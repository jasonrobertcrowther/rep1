I am a player at Abingdon Eagles Basketball club, however I am also a coach and official. 

One of my honours is to be asked to coach for a Community Session setup by the Abingdon Eagles Foundation (https://abingdoneagles.foundation). Every Monday I am an assistant coach for Walking Basketball where people are returning from illness or simply want to play basketball or need some community around them.

The Foundation is funded via external grants that have to be appled for so we decided to create a promotional video showing just what we do.

It was great fun to plan the storyboard out for the video and then coordinate all the people and record and edit the video.

The final video is below

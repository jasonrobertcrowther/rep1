In some respects this was the easiest part. Early on I needed to decide the structure and it made sense to keep it fairly simple. 

The default landing page will have my "blog posts" that are a history of what I am doing or have done.

There will be an archive of all my posts by date so a historical timeline will be seen over time

There will be the main portfolio section that can be accessed from the main home page

Finally a simple about page

The initial blog posts are these information pages about how I got started but as time goes on the focal point will be the Portfolio pages so people can see my content and ideas beind it

There are some neat feature like tags that I can add to every page that will help as content increases allowing access to particular types of content

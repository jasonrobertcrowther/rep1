Hi - my name is Dan Crowther. At the point of writing this article I am 17 years old and living in Abingdon which is in Oxfordshire

I have two passions in life - basketball and video both of which consume my every waking moment.

Currently I am studying Video Editing at Abingdon & Witney College and am in the second year hoping to go 
to University in 2023 to study TV Production. 

I play basketball for Abingdon Eagles U18s National League team and have been playing since the age of 10. In
addition to playing I am a qualified Table Official, Coach and will be taking the Referee course in the New Year.

My two passions overlap and many of my personal videos have been for Abingdon Eagles Basketball club. I have created 
promotional videos and also regularly do end of season videos for many of the teams. Each week I edit and post the 
recorded club games that are used internally for reference and training purposes

The aim of this website is to try and showcase who I am and where I am going with my video projects both personally and 
at College so you can get a feel of my journey with video

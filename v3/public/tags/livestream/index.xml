      <description>This was an experiment in live streaming and person following
My instant thought when doing a livestream is OBS and a laptop and a camera feed. While this can work very well we were looking at how we could stream a live event easily with minimal equipment and also minimal space (and potentially minimal operator skills set)
We found an Aver tracking camera that can track people or objects. What we wanted to do was evaluate the effectiveness of this when livestreaming a basketball game.</description>

      <description>This was an experiment in live streaming and person following
My instant thought when doing a livestream is OBS and a laptop and a camera feed. While this can work very well we were looking at how we could stream a live event easily with minimal equipment and also minimal space (and potentially minimal operator skills set)
We found an Aver tracking camera that can track people or objects. What we wanted to do was evaluate the effectiveness of this when livestreaming a basketball game.</description>

      <description>This was a video that I edited and put together for a basketball end of season highlights celebration
Every game that this particular team play is recorded as a simple video file and then I took all of the best moments from these and added an audio track and this was presented at the club awards and presentation night</description>

      <description>I am a player at Abingdon Eagles Basketball club, however I am also a coach and official.
One of my honours is to be asked to coach for a Community Session setup by the Abingdon Eagles Foundation (https://abingdoneagles.foundation). Every Monday I am an assistant coach for Walking Basketball where people are returning from illness or simply want to play basketball or need some community around them.
The Foundation is funded via external grants that have to be appled for so we decided to create a promotional video showing just what we do.</description>

      <description>This was a video that I edited and put together for a basketball leavers celebration
The concept behind this was to create an emotional yet fun interview type video with all the players in the same age group that all leaving the club going onto university or jobs.
This was filmed in secret so that the coaches to which this is dedicated had no idea of the content.
This was a fun project because I got to write a script of questions and edit together some of the clips out of order</description>
